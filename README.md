# hw-11

1.

-The role of the previousmillis function is to save the time at which the LED was last updated.

-The if statement is essentially checking if the time that has gone by since the last blink is greater than or equal to the interval at which you wish the LED to blink.


-I would change the line:

const long interval = 1000;

to read 

const long interval = 220000;

Im having trouble figuring out exactly what this code does but
i know that a second LED is introduced that blinks at a different
rate from the first. I would try and run it to find out but it will not
upload to the arduino and neither did the code from the first part of this homework.
